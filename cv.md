## About Me:
At the moment I work as a pharmacist. But I would like to become a programmer, because it is interesting for me and gives great opportunities for career growth. I like the Front-end so I decided to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have already completed the Â«JavaScript/Front-end. Stage 0Â» course and now I continue my studies.

## Skills:
* HTML
* CSS (SASS/SCSS) 
* JavaScript
* Git/GitHub
* Figma

## My projects:
* [Audio Player](https://julia17chijonok.github.io/AudioPlayer/audio_player/)
* [Memory Game](https://julia17chijonok.github.io/MemoryGame/)

## Code Examples
```
function findAverage(array) {
  if (array.length == 0){
        return 0;
    }
    else {
        average = array.reduce((sum, current) => sum + current) / array.length;
        return average;
    }
}
```
