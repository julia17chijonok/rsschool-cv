At the moment I work as a pharmacist. But I would like to become a programmer, because it is interesting for me and gives great opportunities for career growth.

## Code Examples
```
function findAverage(array) {
  if (array.length == 0){
        return 0;
    }
    else {
        average = array.reduce((sum, current) => sum + current) / array.length;
        return average;
    }
}
```
